### EXPLORE US BIKESHARE DATA

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science for Enterprise Nanodegree Program.


### OVERVIEW

Make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Build an interactive environment where a user can filter data by any of the 3 cities and calculate statistics on the data set entered. 


### DATA SOURCES

Below are 3 files that were used to analyse the US Bikeshare Data. These files are listed in the .gitignore file as they are huge.
1. chicago.csv 
2. new-york-city.csv
3. washington.csv


### STATISTICS COMPUTED
Below is a list of all the BikeShare data statistics that are computed by the program.

### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

### 2. Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3. Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

### 4. User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

To complete the project, I used the following software:

1. Text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice. I used Visual Studio Code to write the python code. 
2. Jupyter notebook - to test each module of the project. [Installation instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
3. Terminal application (Windows OS) - to test the full project before submission.
